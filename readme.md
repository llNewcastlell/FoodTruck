This app is a helpful way for foodies and food truck connoisseurs to find the mobile restaurants they love. It allows the user to find the food trucks clostest to thier location, update the location of a specific food truck, and leave a review for trucks they've visitied and patronized. 

It was built using a sequalize and handlebars structure.

The app is deployed on heroku at the following link: [https://radiant-river-48005.herokuapp.com/](https://radiant-river-48005.herokuapp.com/)

Future development plans for this project include:
*Auth0 and/or passport user authentication
*Allowing food truck owners to add or update new and existing food trucks
*add a favorite food truck list for users
*connect to the users' social media pages to allow for easy posting and word of mouth advertising

All design and coding element were created by the Hungry Coders Dev team.
